# About
Inspired by the `rails` CLI, nextp is a way to quickly generate boilerplate for Next.js projects. There are 2 ways to install it:
```
yarn global add nextp
npm i -g nextp
```

Currently, nextp only creates new pages in Next.js. The command can be run with the following:
```
nextp NewPage
```

This will create a new page with the given name.

# Roadmap
- [ ] Create API routes
- [ ] Delete pages/API routes
- [ ] CRUD boilerplate
